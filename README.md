# WhareIQ

WhareIQ is a **Semantic SQL & Data Warehouse Intelligence Engine** that allows users to query structured databases using natural language and receive **trusted, explainable, real-time answers**.

It is designed to be a **pure semantic query engine** for analytics and business intelligence — without VectorDB, embeddings, or document RAG.

## 💡 What WhareIQ Does

WhareIQ converts natural language questions into:

Natural Language → Semantic Plan → SQL → Secure Execution → Trusted Data

It enables:
- Founders to ask business questions without SQL
- Analysts to get exact queries and tables
- Developers to integrate semantic querying via API

All answers are generated from the **source-of-truth database**, not from approximated embeddings.
